Welcome to the **UT Systems and Storage Lab**. The lab is directed by
[Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/).

**Mission**: To advance the state-of-the-art in storage and systems in
  the face of new challenges such as the explosion of data and new
  storage techologies. To train the next generation of computer
  scientists and engineers.

We strive to make our systems publicly available whenever possible;
check out the [code](https://utsaslab.github.io/code.html) we have
released. We aim to include both undergraduate and Masters students in
active research. Currently, [we
have](https://utsaslab.github.io/people.html) two PhD students, two
Masters students, and four undergraduate students working with the
lab.

We thank [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov), [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/programs/), and
[VMware](https://labs.vmware.com/academic/academic-software) for
supporting our lab.
