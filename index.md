Welcome to the **UT Systems and Storage Lab**. The lab is directed by
[Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/).

**Mission**: To design new techniques and systems to obtain both high
  performance and correctness in the the new storage landscape with
  big data and new storage technologies. To train the next generation
  of systems builders.

We strive to make our systems publicly available whenever possible;
check out the [code](https://utsaslab.github.io/code.html) we have
released. We aim to include both undergraduate and Masters students in
active research. Currently, [we
have](https://utsaslab.github.io/people.html) three PhD students, one
Masters student, and seven undergraduate students working with the
lab.

We thank [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/programs/) and
[VMware](https://labs.vmware.com/academic/academic-software) for
supporting our lab.
