Welcome to the **UT Systems and Storage Lab**. The lab is directed by
[Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/).

**Mission**: To advance the state-of-the-art in storage and systems in
  the face of new challenges such as the explosion of data and new
  storage techologies. To train the next generation of computer
  scientists and engineers.

We aim to build the next generation of storage systems. This means
building storage systems that have higher performance and stronger
reliability. We build both storage systems and the tools need to
develop such systems rigorously, such as testing frameworks. Our work
involves innovation both at the data-structure level and at the
systems level. We open-source all the software we build, and aim to
have impact both inside academia and in industry.
    
Check out the [code](https://github.com/utsaslab) we have released. We
aim to include both undergraduate and Masters students in active
research. Currently, [we have](https://utsaslab.github.io/people.html)
four PhD students, one Masters student, and two undergraduate students
working with the lab.

We thank [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov),
