  abstract = {Key-value stores such as LevelDB and RocksDB offer excellent write throughput, but suffer high write amplification: 1 GB written to RocksDB results in 28 GB written to storage. The write amplification problem is fundamental to the Log-Structured Merge Trees data structure that underlies these key-value stores. To remedy this, we present a novel data structure that is inspired by Skip Lists, termed Fragmented Log-Structured Merge Trees (FLSM). FLSM introduces the notion of guards to organize logs, and avoids rewriting data in the same level. We build PebblesDB, a high performance key-value store, on top of the FLSM data structure. We evaluate PebblesDB with different benchmarks and show that compared to LevelDB and RocksDB, it decreases write am- plification by 3-5X while increasing write throughput by 2.7X and provides equal or better throughput for other operations such as reads and range queries. We modify two widely-used NoSQL stores, MongoDB and HyperDex, to use PebblesDB as their underlying storage engine, and show that the application throughput is increased by 18-105% (compared to their default storage engines) while write IO is decreased by 35-55%.},
