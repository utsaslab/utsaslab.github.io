          <h2>How To Give A Systems Talk</h2>
          

          <p class="meta">11 Aug 2017</p>

<div class="post">
<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/">Vijay Chidambaram</a>: Jotting down
the advice I give to my students about presenting at a systems
conference. Most of this is advice I got from
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/">Remzi</a> and
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/">Andrea</a> when I went to grad
school at Madison. These aren’t hard and fast rules, and the more
experience you have, the more you will know when you can break them.</p>

<p>Caveat: everybody has different notions of what a good systems talk
should look like. These are merely my own preferences.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The aim of the talk is to get the big idea from the paper across.</strong></p>

    <p>You don’t need to present every detail from the paper. You need to
get the audience interested enough to go look at your paper.</p>

    <p>In a similar vein, don’t show every graph from the paper.  Show
 the most interesting graphs, and point at the paper for the rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remember your audience hasn’t been thinking about this for as long as you have.</strong></p>

    <p>Build up material as you go, introduce definitions and terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build up your slide</strong></p>

    <p>Don’t throw a whole out of text and pictures at the audience at
 once. They will get lost. Instead, put <strong>only</strong> what you are
 currently talking about on the screen.</p>

    <p>A good example of this is showing a graph to the audience. First
 show the axes, explain what they are. If you have multiple bars,
 introduce them one by one, comment about performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Whenever possible, use pictures and animation.</strong></p>

    <p>It is possible to go overboard on animation, but in general most
 talks don’t have enough of it. Making animations is a lot of work,
 but your audience will be more engaged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoid walls of text</strong></p>

    <p>Each slide should have a major point it is trying to make. Don’t
 have more than 3 sub-bullets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have a takeaway slide</strong></p>

    <p>I’m a big fan of a slide in the talk which asks a big question
 that your work solves, and in a line gives the intuition for your
 solution. This is the takeaway slide. See Slide 5 and 6 in my <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/optfs-sosp13-slides.pdf">OptFS talk</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pause between major sections of your talk, and at the end of each slide</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repeat important intuition/insights at multiple points in the talk.</strong></p>

    <p>Your audience will zone out occassionally. You still want them to
be able to get the main idea of the paper.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>

<p>I like talks organized like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduction to the Problem, what your solution is (5 min)</li>
  <li>Outline slide, what is the rest of the talk</li>
  <li>The Problem</li>
  <li>Our Solution</li>
  <li>How it Performs</li>
  <li>Summary (give intuition again)</li>
  <li>A thought-provoking conclusion</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m partial to a color scheme where the title slide, the outline
slide, and the slide with major points have a black background. The
other slides have a white background and black text. See <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/papers/hotstorage17-crashmonkey-slides.pdf">recent
talks</a>
from our group for an example of this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t use font smaller than 24 pt on your slides.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your talk should have a small color palette (apart from
animation). A background color, a text color, a color for emphasis. I
like to use white slides, black text, red for emphasis.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="length">Length</h3>

<p>For a 25 minute slot, your talk should be around 23-24 minutes. If
questions are included in the slot, your talk should be 20-21
minutes. Nobody likes a talk that goes over the time limit.</p>

<h3 id="practice-and-iteration">Practice and Iteration</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your first version of the talk will be bad. This is the case for
everyone. Give multiple practice talks and keep improving the talk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good rule of thumb is to have revised the talk at least twice,
and practised at least three times before giving the talk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memorize the first few slides so that you can work through them
without mental effort.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>Invest in getting Keynote. It is definitely worth it.</p>
